# Budget Tracking Smart Contract

## Introduction

The Budget Tracking Smart Contract is a Move-based blockchain contract designed to facilitate budget management and expense tracking on the SUI blockchain platform. This contract allows users to record expenses, manage budgets, and track refunds within a decentralized environment.

## Prerequisites

Before using the smart contract, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

### Ubuntu/Debian/WSL2(Ubuntu):
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl git-all cmake gcc libssl-dev pkg-config libclang-dev libpq-dev build-essential -y
```

### MacOS (using Homebrew):
```
brew install curl cmake git libpq
```

### Rust and Cargo:
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### SUI:
Download pre-built binaries (recommended for GitHub Codespaces):
```
./download-sui-binaries.sh "v1.18.0" "devnet" "ubuntu-x86_64"
```
Or build from source:
```
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch devnet sui
```

### Dev Tools (optional, not required for GitHub Codespaces):
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/move-language/move move-analyzer --branch sui-move --features "address32"
```

## Configuration

### Run a Local Network:
```
RUST_LOG="off,sui_node=info" sui-test-validator
```

### Configure Connectivity to a Local Node:
```
sui client active-address
```
Follow the prompts and provide the full node URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:9000) and a name for the configuration (e.g., localnet).

### Create Addresses:
```
sui client new-address ed25519
```

### Get Localnet SUI Tokens:
Run the HTTP request to mint SUI tokens to the active address:
```
curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```
Replace `<ADDRESS>` with the active address obtained from `sui client active-address`.

## Building and Publishing the Smart Contract

### Build the Package:
```
sui move build
```

### Publish the Package:
```
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000 --skip validation verification
```

## Usage

After building and publishing the smart contract, you can interact with it using SUI client commands or integrate it into your blockchain application.
